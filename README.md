Nintendo DS Raguna Application Framework

The Raguna Application Framework is targeted to Nintendo DS platforms for
building application like interfaces with controls. Raguna is not a game

scout other teams during [FIRST](http://www.usfirst.com) FRC competitions.

NDSRAF is flexible and general purpose. It can be used to develop any number of
different applicationd for scouting, data collection, or just simple fun.
